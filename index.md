Hello! I am a third-year PhD student in the Sustainable Development program at Columbia Universityâ€™s School of International and Public Affairs.

My primary research interests are in energy transition, climate change and how they affect labor market.

Prior to joining Columbia, I worked as a predoctoral fellow in the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).

I graduated from New Economic School in Moscow, Russia with BA in Economics. 

In my free time, I enjoy drawing, running, and exploring the city.
